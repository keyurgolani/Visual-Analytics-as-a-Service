Full details will be in the article, but here's a quickstart:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure that `uploads/` is writeable
3. Optionally run `vagrant up`, then `vagrant ssh`, then `cd /vagrant`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `bower install`
6. Run the app with `node index.js`
7. The app will run on port 8080
